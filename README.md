# SVHN Digit Recognition Using Neural Networks

## Introduction
This project aims to leverage neural networks for recognizing house numbers in images from the Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset. The ability to automatically process and recognize house numbers has significant applications, including improving geolocation services.

## Objective
Develop a neural network model that can accurately identify and classify house numbers from images.

## Dataset Overview
- **Number of Classes:** 10
- **Training Data:** 42,000 images
- **Testing Data:** 18,000 images

## Environment and Libraries
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow==2.8.2
```

## Loading the Dataset
```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
X_train = pd.read_csv("/content/drive/MyDrive/AIML/X_train.csv")
y_train = pd.read_csv("/content/drive/MyDrive/AIML/y_train.csv")
X_test = pd.read_csv("/content/drive/MyDrive/AIML/X_test.csv")
y_test = pd.read_csv("/content/drive/MyDrive/AIML/y_test.csv")
```

## Data Preprocessing
Normalization and one-hot encoding were applied to prepare the data for the neural network.

## Model Architecture
The model comprises multiple dense layers with ReLU activation and a softmax output layer. Dropout layers were included to prevent overfitting.

## Training the Model
The model was compiled with the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function. It was trained for 100 epochs with a batch size of 128.

## Evaluation
The model achieved ~80% accuracy on the test set. Precision, recall, and F1-scores across classes were reported using a classification report, and performance was visualized with a confusion matrix.

## Conclusion and Future Work
The project demonstrates the potential of neural networks in digit recognition tasks. Future work could explore more complex architectures and data augmentation to improve performance.
